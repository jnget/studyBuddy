I enjoy working with kids and helping parents keep their kids healthy. Dr. Tan showed me that in order to succeed as a pediatric doctor, or doctor in general, you must be up to date with the current medical studies, especially with COVID. Being knowledgeable ensures that you are giving your patients the upmost care in regards to their situation. Additionally, you must be empathetic and patient as a Pediatrician because the parents of the kids are going to be worried and want the best for their child and it can cause them to act in ways they normally wouldn't.</p>

Through her, I learned how important your relationships are with your patient. Ensuring good repoir with your patients will build their trust and respect. By doing so, they will be more willing to listen to your advice. Additionally, I learned how important having a good attitude is. Her infectious personality helps relieve her patients from their pain or sickness, making her practice effective right when you see her.</p>

Dr. Tsai is very calm and knowledgeable. His calm nature and tone of voice allows him to calm down any disgruntled patient. Being calm is important in deescalating any situation. Patients are sick and can be irritable, if their medication isn't working, they tend to blame the doctor. His demeanor and knowledge allows his patients to slow down and clearly talk about their problems. By doing so, he is able to effectively treat them. </p>
